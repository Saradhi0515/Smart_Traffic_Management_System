This Project Aims To Develop An Smart Traffic Management System Using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) & Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC).
By Leveraging Deep Learning & Object Detection Techniques, The System Will Automate Traffic Monitoring & Control In Smart City Environments. 
ANPR Will Detect & Recognize Vehicle License Plates.
While ATCC Will Classify Different Types Of Traffic & Automate Traffic Signals Accordingly. 
The System Will Improve Traffic Flow, Reduce Congestion & Enhance Road Safety.
